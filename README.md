## Overview![Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 7 43 06 PM](https://github.com/marlonbarrios/unstablelandscapeinfoviz/assets/90220317/80fbfc07-760f-4874-b005-ed1f2cdc5f69)


"Unstable Landscape" is an artistic visualization project designed to dynamically represent various concepts from art and research like dance improvisation, embodied cognition, creative coding, etc. It uses p5.js for fluid, interactive visuals based on Perlin noise. This tool not only serves as an exploration of complex ideas but also as an educational platform to engage with these concepts through an interactive web experience.

## Live Demo

Access the live visualization [here](https://github.com/marlonbarrios/unstablelandscapeinfoviz/blob/mondrian/sketch.js).

## Features

- **Dynamic Visuals**: Offers a naturalistic, engaging representation of concepts using Perlin noise.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can adjust animation speed and toggle the visibility of lines, ellipses, and text via a slider and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Wide Array of Concepts**: Visualizes a broad spectrum of ideas, from machine learning to Web3, encouraging exploration and understanding.
